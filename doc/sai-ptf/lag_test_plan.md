## Overriew
The purpose of this test plan is to test the LAG/PortChannel function from SAI.

### Test Topology
For SAI-PTF, it will use a non-topology network structure for the sai testing. 

### Testbed
Those tests will be run on the testbed structure, the components are:
* PTF - running in a server that can connect to the target DUT
* SAI server - running on a dut

*p.s. cause the SAI testing will not depend on any sonic components, then there will be no specific topology(T0 T1 T2) for testing.*

## Scope
The test will include two parts
1. Lag functionalities
   - Load balancing
2. Lag SAI APIs
   - create/check/remove lag and lag member


# Basic SAI APIs and sample packets

## APIs

Create lag and lag member
```Python
sai_thrift_create_lag(self.client)
sai_thrift_create_lag_member(
            self.client, lag_id=lag3, port_id=self.port24)
```

Get lag members
```Python
sai_thrift_get_lag_attribute(
            self.client, lag3, port_list=portlist)
count = attr_list["SAI_LAG_ATTR_PORT_LIST"].count
```

Get port counter
```Python
counter_results = sai_thrift_get_port_stats(client, port)

counter_results["SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN_DISCARDS"],
counter_results["SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN_DISCARDS"],
counter_results["SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN_UCAST_PKTS"],
counter_results["SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_OUT_UCAST_PKTS"]))
```

Add fdb entry
```python
sai_thrift_fdb_entry_t(switch_id=self.switch_id, mac_address=mac1, bv_id=self.vlan_oid)
sai_thrift_create_fdb_entry(
            self.client,
            fdb_entry,
            type=SAI_FDB_ENTRY_TYPE_STATIC,
            bridge_port_id=port_bp,
            packet_action=SAI_PACKET_ACTION_FORWARD)
```

Remove lag member
```Python
sai_thrift_remove_lag_member(self.client,  self.lag1_member6)
```

## Packets
Vlan tagged packet
```Python
simple_udp_packet(eth_dst=dst_mac,
                    eth_src=src_mac,
                    dl_vlan_enable=True,
                    vlan_vid=vlan_id,
                    pktlen=104)
```

# Test suites
## Test suite #1: PortChannel Loadbalanceing
For load balancing, expecting the ports in a lag should receive the packet equally.

Even after removing and disabling the port in a lag.

Sample APIS
Disbale egress
```Python
sai_thrift_set_lag_member_attribute(
                self.client,
                self.lag1_member4,
                ingress_disable=True,
                egress_disable=True)
```

|  Goal| Steps/Cases  | Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| Create lag and member| Create lag, add lag members, port1 - 4. Add FDB entry for lag, map with a MAC. | lag, and member created|
| Prepare to send from lag to VLAN.| Send packet with.| Vlan and members have been created.|
| Packet forwards on port equally.| Send packet on port0 to the lag by specifying lag mac as dest mac. 4 times .| Loadbalance on lag members.|
| Packet forwards on available ports equally.| Every time, disable egress/ingress on one lag member, then send packet | Loadbalance on lag members.|
| Packet forwards on available ports equally.| Every time, enable egress/ingress on one lag member, then send packet | Loadbalance on lag members.|
| Packet forwards on available ports equally.| Every time, remove one lag member, then send packet | Loadbalance on lag members.|

## Test suite #2: Ingress/Egreee disable
For lag, we can disable it from ingress or egress direction, after we disable the member of a lag, we expect traffic can be loadbalanced to other lag members.

Sample APIs

Ingress/Egreee disable
```python
    status = sai_thrift_set_lag_member_attribute(
        self.client,
        self.lag1_member4,
        ingress_disable=True,
        egress_disable=True)

```

lag port list
```Python
sai_thrift_get_lag_attribute(
                self.client, self.lag1, port_list=portlist)
```

| Goal | Steps/Cases | Expect  |
|-|-|-|
| Create lag and member| Add FDB entry for port4 map to a MAC. Create lag and add port4 as a member. | lag, and member created|
| Prepare to send from lag to VLAN.| Create VLAN and add VLAN member with port0 and port1.| Vlan and members have been created.|
| Forwarding from port1 to port4.| Send packet on port1 with target mac on port4. | Receive packet on port4.|
|Packet dropped on port4| Disable egress and ingress on lag member4. send packet | Packet drop.|
|Packet flooding on VLAN members, port0 and port1.| Enable lag egress and ingress. Send packet with VLAN tag on lag port4 with a new dest mac.|Packet received.|

## Test suite #3: Remove Lag member 
Sample APIs
create packet
```python
simple_tcp_packet(eth_dst='00:11:11:11:11:11',
                                    eth_src='00:22:22:22:22:22',
                                    ip_dst=dst_ip_addr,
                                    ip_src='192.168.8.1',
                                    ip_id=109,
                                    ip_ttl=64)
```
Remove Lag member
```python
     print("Remove LAG member 4")
     status = sai_thrift_remove_lag_member(self.client, self.lag1_member4)

```
How to check if each port of Lag receive an equal number of packets (if we have n members in a Lag), 
```python
 self.max_itrs =100
 for i in range(0, n):
                self.assertTrue((count[i] >= ((self.max_itrs / n) * 0.7)),

```
| Goal | Steps/Cases | Expect  |
|-|-|-|
|1.Create lag and member|Create lag1 and add port4,port5,port6 as member.| lag, and member created|
|2.Forwarding packet from port1 to any port of lag1.|Send packet on port1 to lag1 100 times.|Each port of lag1 receive an equal number of packets.|
|3.Remove port6 and forwarding packet from port1 to port4,5|Remove port6 form Lag1 and do step2 again| Port4 and port5 will  receive an equal number of packets.|
|4. Remove port5 from Lag1, do step3 again|
